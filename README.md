    --- Tutorial ---
    This game can be played with 2 or more players. 
    If you see ... in the terminal, press enter to continue.
    At the very beginning you choose the number of players by creating exactly that many trainers.
    If enter the wrong number of trainers, don't worry, you can always either create a dummy trainer or create an additional trainer later.
    Each of the players can then create their trainer. (max name length is 20 characters)
    Everyone can then choose from 3 randomly picked cichnamon and name them as well.
    Once you've created your trainers and made a starter choice, you have 7 options:
		#0 Save - If you've just created your trainers, this saves them. If you don't want to loose progress it saves it. Just a save. Doesn't end the game.
        #1 Fight - here you choose 2 trainers, who will then fight with their cichnamon.
    You can attack, which will let you choose from your cichnamons moves, if a cichnamon defeats other cichnamon, 
    then they gain xp which contributes to leveling up.
    Each moves has a number of uses, showed by it's "charge", if it reaches 0, it can no longer be used in battle.
    Each move also has a specific damage value, which also depends on type advantages. Fire beats grass etc.
    There's also a chance that an attack will miss or that it will crit.
    There will also be moves, which don't do damage but instead heal yourself or your ally cichnamon or just debuff your opponent.
    You can choose defense, where your cichnamon will gain a shield of a power, 
    which depends on it's defense and can only be chosen if it doesn't already have a shield active.
    You can also switch between your cichnamon, if you have more than one. (max number of cichnamon for one trainer is 6)
    Or you can run away, which ends the battle and the trainer running away automatically loses.
    Once a fight has come to an end to winner gets money from the loser. (300 $ normally, 450 for running away)
        #2 Cichcenter - here you can restore your cichnamons HP and move charge or not, if you dare.
        #3 Venture into the wilds - here you and your friends can go into the wilds and try to find a random cichnamon.
        #4 Show trainer statistics - will show you your stats and cichnamon.
        #5 Create a trainer - if you want to create another trainer, then you can do so here.
        #6 Save and exit - saves your progress and then exits from the game.
	Just a last thing, there is a slight chance, that a bug exists and that would ruin your progress if you haven't saved.
	So save ocasionally please!!
    That's all all you need to know. Have fun!
